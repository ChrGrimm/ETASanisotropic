# ETASanisotropic
This project contains Matlab code to estimate an Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. The implementation advances the standard ETAS model by enabling anisotropic spatial kernels and accounting for short-term aftershock incompleteness.

Please refer to the user manuals for precise instructions on how to use the code.
